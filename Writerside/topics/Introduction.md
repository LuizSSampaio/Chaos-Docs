# Introduction

Chaos, an ambitious game engine, is dedicated to providing a platform for learning the intricacies of game development
and creating immersive gaming experiences. Developed in C++, it leverages the power of OpenGL to facilitate a
comprehensive understanding of graphics programming.

## Caution: For Learning Purposes

Chaos is intentionally designed as a foundational learning tool, allowing developers to delve into the complexities of
game engine architecture. Acknowledging the name Chaos, the engine is expected to present challenges inherent in the
development process.

## Not Recommended for Advanced Projects

It's important to highlight that Chaos may not be the optimal choice for advanced or production-level projects. Given
its status as a learning project, continuous updates and maintenance are not guaranteed. For endeavors requiring
stability and long-term support, exploring more established engines is advisable.

## Community Involvement

Chaos invites developers to engage in a community-driven approach. Developed in C++ and leveraging OpenGL, it offers a
platform for enthusiasts to experiment with graphics programming and game development.
